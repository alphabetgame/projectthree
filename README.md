## About the Project

Letter Scramble is a React app built to help young children who have fallen behind in spelling due to COVID-19. Parents want an easy-to-use platform their children can go to regularly to practice spelling in a safe, fun, and engaging way.

Letter Scramble targets preschool and elementary aged children who require extra practice with English spelling.

## Built With

This is a MERN stack application.

React was used for the front end with a mix of raw CSS and Bootstrap framework styling.
GraphQL was used for modelling and querying, with a Node.js and Express.js server.
MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM was used for the database in which the initial seeds were created for data storage.
This application was deployed using Heroku.

## Getting Started

This application requires a name, email, and password to use. This sign-up feature allows parents to save their child's scores and keep track of the practice they have done through the app.

Because the application is deployed on Heroku with the seed data, the application is ready to use once the user hits the homepage.

## Installation

To build this application, we ran an "npm i" in the root, client, and server folders.

Then, an "npm run build" was required in order to compile our javascript and css files into the "build" folder in the client section. This helps the application load quickly.

An "npm run seed" is required to align the information stored in the MongoDB with the live application. In our case, the database stores information on the user and the games themselves.

Finally, "npm run develop" is required to launch the application.

It is important to note, this application has been deployed to Heroku, so the steps listed above were finalized on the development side and are not required to use the application.
